# UE_TexturePath_Updater

‚ú® Key Features

This tool solves the common problem where source texture files have been moved or replaced on the disk. Instead of manually updating every asset, the script performs the following:


‚ö°Ô∏è Automates the Process: Iterates through all Texture2D assets in your project.


üîç Name Matching: Searches for a file with an identical name in your specified folder.


üîÑ Update & Reimport: When a match is found, it updates the asset's Source File Path and calls the reimport_asset() function to load the new data instantly.


CRITICAL: For successful matching, the file names in your source folder must exactly match the names of the texture assets in Unreal Engine.


‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Unreal Engine 4.24 or later.


The Python Editor Script Plugin must be enabled (Edit ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Scripting).
